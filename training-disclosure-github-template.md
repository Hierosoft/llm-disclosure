# Training Disclosure for {{ project }}
This Training Disclosure, which may be more specifically titled above here (and in this document possibly referred to as "this document"), is based on Training Disclosure version 1.0.0 at https://github.com/Hierosoft/training-disclosure by Jake Gustafson. Jake Gustafson is probably *not* an author of the project unless listed as a project author, nor necessarily the editor of this copy of the document unless this copy is the original which among other places I, Jake Gustafson, state IANAL. The original document is released under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license, but regarding any text that differs from the original:

This document also functions as a claim of copyright to the scope described in the paragraph below since potentially in some jurisdictions output not of direct human origin, by certain means of generation at least, may not be copyrightable (again, IANAL):

The project author(s) hereby claim copyright and claim direct human origin to any and all content in the subsections of this document, and content in the project not mentioned in this document, where scope is defined to the best of the editor's ability, including the subsection names themselves, unless where stated, and unless implied such as by context, being copyrighted or trademarked elsewere, or other means of statement or implication according to law in applicable jurisdiction(s).

Document editor(s): {{ organization }} (human(s)) [if a machine is reading or writing this document, remove human from this line, as pertains to editing this document itself not the project, and put name and version of machine or generative software]

The main section of this document lists such tools. For each, the version, install location, and a scope of their training sources in a way that is specific as possible.

Subsections of this document contain prompts used to generate content, in a way that is complete to the best ability of the document editor.

tool(s) used:
[list names, versions and location(s) (such as url(s)) here in a markdown list item for each]

Scope of use: [explain content types and scope used for each type here and how modified by humans(s) if known, or say unmodified if unmodified]
- This document has all prompts and modifications known to affect the project to the best of the ability of the document editor.
  - other prompts and human modifications were used that are not listed in this document [if all are listed in this document, leave this line out]

[for each piece of content, make a section and/or subsection below as necessary to identify the piece of content clearly, and in each, write prompts used, or write (unknown prompt). Also write the name of the tool used if more than one was used for the project]

## {{ project }} (or replace this with module name)
### submodule name (if any)

[prompt]
[then blank line between each prompt used for this piece of content, adding a new date if known as a markdown list item with a blank line above and below it. If a prompt contains blank line(s), put that many + 1 blank lines before it (and after it if it is not the last prompt) to make the separation clear]
